# Sankey diagram


Sankey diagrams are a specific type of flow diagram used for visualization of material, cost or energy flows.

Using Sankey diagrams you communicate your data effectively and get your message across: Whether it is to external stakeholders or within your project team.

- Visualization of material and energy flows
- Universally and versatilely deployable
- Width of the arrows is proportional to the flow quantity
- Named after the Irish engineer Captain Matthew H.R. Sankey (1853-1925)
